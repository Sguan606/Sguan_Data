# My private code storage space
This is mainly to store some code that I wrote when I was studying at Jiangsu University of Science and Technology to practice my hands. This includes, but is not limited to, testing programs, code modules, and syntax analysis.

As the saying goes, read thousands of miles of books, travel thousands of miles. I am willing to ride the wind and waves, and there will be a time when I will sail through the clouds and sail into the sea. This is a space that I often come to practice writing code on a daily basis.

这个空间是用于存放我在江苏科技大学学习期间编写的代码，能够更方便锻炼我的编程能力。它不限于测试程序、代码模块和语法分析等知识点...而会有很多很多项目在这个地方被我挖掘。
如一话所说，“读万卷书不如行万里路。”我愿意乘风破浪，未来定能披云破雾，乘风远航。这是我每天来练习编写代码的地方，也是我不断进步的空间。

JUST do it！I really hope that after many days, this place will be so rich that every time I look at it in the future, I will be reminded of my student days.
